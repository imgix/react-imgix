## Overview / Resources

**Before you get started with react-imgix**, it's _highly recommended_ that you read Eric Portis' [seminal article on `srcset` and `sizes`](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/). This article explains the history of responsive images in responsive design, why they're necessary, and how all these technologies work together to save bandwidth and provide a better experience for users. The primary goal of react-imgix is to make these tools easier for developers to implement, so having an understanding of how they work will significantly improve your react-imgix experience.

Below are some other articles that help explain responsive imagery, and how it can work alongside imgix:

- [Using imgix with `<picture>`](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/using-imgix-picture-element). Discusses the differences between art direction and resolution switching, and provides examples of how to accomplish art direction with imgix.
- [Responsive Images with `srcset` and imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/responsive-images-srcset-imgix). A look into how imgix can work with `srcset` and `sizes` to serve the right image.

## Installation

- **NPM**: `npm install react-imgix`
- **Yarn**: `yarn add react-imgix`

This module exports two transpiled versions. If a ES6-module-aware bundler is being used to consume this module, it will pick up an ES6 module version and can perform tree-shaking. **If you are not using ES6 modules, you don't have to do anything**

## Usage

```js
import Imgix from 'react-imgix'

// in react component
<Imgix src={string} />
```

### Examples

#### Basic use case

For simply using as you would use an `<img>`, react-imgix can be used as follows:

```js
import Imgix from "react-imgix";

<Imgix src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg" sizes="100vw" />;
```

**Please note:** `100vw` is an appropriate `sizes` value for a full-bleed image. If your image is not full-bleed, you should use a different value for `sizes`. [Eric Portis' "Srcset and sizes"](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/) article goes into depth on how to use the `sizes` attribute.

This will generate HTML similar to the following:

```html
<img
	src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg?auto=format&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=react-7.2.0"
	sizes="100vw"
	srcset="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg?auto=format&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=react-7.2.0&amp;w=100 100w, https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg?auto=format&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=react-7.2.0&amp;w=200 200w,..."
>
```

Since imgix can generate as many derivative resolutions as needed, react-imgix calculates them programmatically, using the dimensions you specify. All of this information has been placed into the srcset and sizes attributes.

**Width and height known:** If the width and height are known beforehand, it is recommended that they are set explicitly:

```js
import Imgix from "react-imgix";

<Imgix
  src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg"
  width={100} // This sets what resolution the component should load from the CDN and the size of the resulting image
  height={200}
/>;
```

NB: Since this library sets [`fit`](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url/size/fit) to `crop` by default, when just a width or height is set, the image will resize and maintain aspect ratio. When both are set, the image will be cropped to that size, maintaining pixel aspect ratio (i.e. edges are clipped in order to not stretch the photo). If this isn't desired, set `fit` to be another value (e.g. `clip`)

#### Server-side rendering

React-imgix also works well on the server. Since react-imgix uses `srcset` and `sizes`, it allows the browser to render the correctly sized image immediately after the page has loaded.

```js
import Imgix from "react-imgix";

<Imgix src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg" sizes="100vw" />;
```

If the width and height are known beforehand, it is recommended that they are set explicitly:

```js
import Imgix from "react-imgix";

<Imgix
  src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg"
  width={100} // This sets what resolution the component should load from the CDN and the size of the resulting image
  height={200}
/>;
```

#### Flexible image rendering

This component acts dynamically by default. The component will leverage `srcset` and `sizes` to render the right size image for its container. This is an example of this responsive behaviour.

`sizes` should be set properly for this to work well, and some styling should be used to set the size of the component rendered. Without `sizes` and correct styling the image might render at full-size.

`./styles.css`

```css
.App {
  display: flex;
}

.App > img {
  margin: 10px auto;
  width: 10vw;
  height: 200px;
}
```

`./app.css`

```js
import "./styles.css";

<div className="App">
  <Imgix
    src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg"
    sizes="calc(10% - 10px)"
  />
</div>;
```

#### Fixed image rendering (i.e. non-flexible)

If the fluid, dynamic nature explained above is not desired, the width and height can be set explicitly.

```js
import Imgix from "react-imgix";

<Imgix
  src="https://assets.imgix.net/examples/pione.jpg"
  width={100} // This sets what resolution the component should load from the CDN and the size of the resulting image
  height={200}
/>;
```

#### Picture support

Using the [<picture> element](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/using-imgix-picture-element) you can create responsive images:

```js
<Imgix src={src} type="picture">
  <Imgix
    src={src}
    width={400}
    type="source"
    imgProps={{ media: "(min-width: 768px)" }}
  />
  <Imgix
    src={src}
    width={200}
    type="source"
    imgProps={{ media: "(min-width: 320px)" }}
  />
  <Imgix src={src} width={100} type="img" />
</Imgix>
```

#### Background mode

This feature has been removed from react-imgix when `sizes` and `srcset` was implemented. It was decided that it was too hard to implement this feature consistently. If you would still like to use this feature, please give this issue a thumbs up: [https://github.com/imgix/react-imgix/issues/160].(https://github.com/imgix/react-imgix/issues/160) If we get enough requests for this, we will re-implement it.

### Props

#### src :: string, required

Usually in the form: `https://[your_domain].imgix.net/[image]`. Don't include any parameters.

#### imgixParams :: object

Imgix params to add to the image `src`.

_For example_:

```js
<Imgix imgixParams={{ mask: "ellipse" }} />
```

#### sizes :: string

Specified the developer's expected size of the image element when rendered on the page. Similar to width. E.g. `100vw`, `calc(50vw - 50px)`, `500px`. Highly recommended when not passing `width` or `height`. [Eric Portis' "Srcset and sizes"](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/) article goes into depth on how to use the `sizes` attribute.

#### type :: string, default = 'img'

What kind of component to render, one of `img`, picture`,`source`.

#### className :: string

`className` applied to top level component. To set `className` on the image itself see `imgProps`.

#### height :: number

Force images to be a certain height.

#### width :: number

Force images to be a certain width.

#### disableSrcSet :: bool, default = false

Disable generation of variable width src sets to enable responsiveness.

#### disableLibraryParam :: bool

By default this component adds a parameter to the generated url to help imgix with analytics and support for this library. This can be disabled by setting this prop to `true`.

#### imgProps :: object

Any other attributes to add to the html node (example: `alt`, `data-*`, `className`).

#### onMounted :: func

Called on `componentDidMount` with the mounted DOM node as an argument.

## Upgrade Guides

### 7.x to 8.0

The largest change in this major version bump is the move to width-based `srcSet` and `sizes` for responsiveness. This has a host of benefits, including better server rendering, better responsiveness, less potential for bugs, perfomance improvements

To upgrade to version 8, the following changes should be made.

- A `sizes` prop should be added to all usages of Imgix. If `sizes` is new to you (or even if it's not), Eric's [seminal article on `srcset` and `sizes`](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/) is highly recommended.
- Remove all usage of `type='bg'` as it is no longer supported. It was decided that it was too hard to implement this feature consistently. If you would still like to use this feature, please give this issue a thumbs up: [https://github.com/imgix/react-imgix/issues/160].(https://github.com/imgix/react-imgix/issues/160) If we get enough requests for this, we will re-implement it.
- Remove props `aggressiveLoad`, `component`, `fluid`, `precision` as they are no longer used.
- Change all usages of `defaultHeight` and `defaultWidth` to `width` and `height` props.
- Rename `generateSrcSet` to `disableSrcSet` and invert the value passed down as the prop's value. i.e. `generateSrcSet={false}` becomes `disableSrcSet={true}` or simply `disableSrcSet`
- If support is needed for a [browser which does not support the new usage of srcSet](https://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset) (such as IE 11), we recommended adding a polyfill, such as the great [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill).

## Browser Support

- By default, browsers that don't support [`srcset`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset), [`sizes`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset), or [`picture`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=picture) will gracefully fall back to the default `img` `src` when appropriate. If you want to provide a fully-responsive experience for these browsers, react-imgix works great alongside [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill)!
- We support the latest version of Google Chrome (which [automatically updates](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414) whenever it detects that a new version of the browser is available). We also support the current and previous major releases of desktop Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari on a rolling basis. Mobile support is tested on the most recent minor version of the current and previous major release for the default browser on iOS and Android (e.g., iOS 9.2 and 8.4). Each time a new version is released, we begin supporting that version and stop supporting the third most recent version.

This browser support is made possible by the great support from [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/).
