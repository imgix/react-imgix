v6.0.0 / 2017-05-05
==================

### Breaking Changes

* **React 0.14 no longer supported.** This `react-imgix` version drops official support for React 0.14. This package will probably still work with 0.14, but we will not accept bugs or issues relating to React 0.14.
* **bg prop removed**. This prop was deprecated in the past, and has now been removed. Please upgrade all usages to: `type='bg'`.

### Important Note

Since this package now uses `prop-types`, when using a React version below 15.5, there will be duplicate propTypes. To fix this, please upgrade to 15.5, which no longer exports React.PropTypes.

### Thanks
